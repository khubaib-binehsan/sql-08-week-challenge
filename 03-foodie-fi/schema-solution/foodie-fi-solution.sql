-- Customer 11 started with free trial on 19-11-2020 but did not subscribed to any other plan, thus churned on 26-11-2020 after the 7-day free trial period ended.

-- c-ChallengePaymentQuestion
-- 01. The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
-- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
--only the first 10 rows are shown as output
