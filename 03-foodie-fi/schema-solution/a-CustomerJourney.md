Customer 1 started with free trial on 01-08-2020, and subsequently subscribed to the basic monthly plan on 08-08-2020 after the 7-day free trial period ended.

Customer 2 started with free trial on 20-09-2020, and subsequently subscribed to the pro annual plan on 27-09-2020 after the 7-day free trial period ended.

Customer 11 started with free trial on 19-11-2020 but did not subscribed to any other plan, thus churned on 26-11-2020 after the 7-day free trial period ended.

Customer 15 started with free trial on 17-03-2020, and subsequently subscribed to the pro annula plan on 24-03-2020 after the 7-day free trial period ended. One month later the customer churned on 29-04-2020.
